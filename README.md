> Minimal, Reactive Form data handling

- **Fully written in Typescript**
- **Turns form into a signal of field values (user input & some metadata)**
- **Framework Agnostic**
- **Easy integration with any custom validation logic**
- **Super tiny with ZERO dependencies**

## Install

```sh
npm install --save @metronlabs/rx-form-data
```

```typescript
// using ES6 modules
import RxFormData from "@metronlabs/rx-form-data";

// using CommonJS modules
const RxFormData = require("@metronlabs/rx-form-data");
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@metronlabs/rx-form-data/lib/index.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.RxFormData`.

## Usage

```typescript
import RxFormData from "@metronlabs/rx-form-data";
const { subscribe, register, dispatch, ACTION_TYPE } = RxFormData(
  "some-form-id",
  // form submission handler. This is required.
  (formvalues, formvalidation, formdata) => {
    // do some custom logic before XHR/AJAX calls... formdata is an HTML5 FormData object of the `some-form-id` form element
    console.log(
      "ON SUBMIT HANDLER CALLED",
      formvalues,
      formvalidation,
      formdata
    );
    return Promise.resolve([formvalues]);
  }
);

//Registers all the input fields on the `some-form-id` form element
dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.REGISTER_ALL);

//Alternatively, you can  choose which fields to register
//That can be done this way ...
dispatch(ATION_TYPE.REGISTER, ["some-field-x", "some-field-y"]);
// OR, this way
const unregister = register(["some-field-x", "some-field-y"]);
// ^ advantage of the later is that you get the 'unregister' function;

//For validation, add some decoders.
//A decoder has a name/label, a bunch of predicates with formvalues as input, and (static or computed) error messages
dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.ADD_DECODERS, [
  {
    name: "validation-for-some-field-x",
    use: [
      (formvalues) => {
        //...some logic
        return true; // if returned value is not 'true' <=> validation failed!
      }
    ],
    messages: ["Input is invalid"] // this can also be a function (context) => string | string[]
  }
]);

const unsubscribe = subscribe((formvalues, formvalidation) => {
  //formvalues includes data for all the currently registered fields
  //formvalidation is derived from formvalues and the registered decoders...
  console.info("FORM DATA SUBSCRIBER", formvalues, formvalidation);
});

// You can have more than one subscriber (...just dont go crazy with it; all things in moderation and all)
const unsubscribe2 = subscribe((formvalues, formvalidation) => {
  console.info("FORM DATA SUBSCRIBER II", formvalues, formvalidation);
});

// some time later... when y'er done
setTimeout(() => {
  unsubscribe();
  unsubscribe2();
}, 2 * 60 * 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
  // clean up: unmounts all form element listners, dettaches all subscribers, clears registered fields & decoders...
  dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.DESTROY);
}, 3 * 60 * 1000);
```

## API

Scan the type declarations (`@types` folder) for some insights on implementation details:

- `RxFormData`
  Main package function. Use this to create an RxFormData instance.

```typescript
const { subscribe, register, dispatch, ACTION_TYPE } = RxFormData(
  "...",
  // Form submission handler...
  // Keep in mind, you are fully responsible for how to handle this event.
  // All this library does is give you enough information to know what to do
  // The formdata parameter is the FormData object of the form element at the moment a submission is triggered
  (formvalues, formvalidation, formdata) => {...}
);
```

- `subscribe`
  Sets up subscriptions to form values and form validation updates. Takes a function as argument.

```typescript
 const unsubscribe = subscribe((formvalues, formvalidation) => {...});

 //when subscription is no longer needed...
 unsubscribe()

```

- `register`
  Registers form field elements. Accepts a list of field names or regex expressions that are meant to match one or multiple field names.

```typescript
const unregister = register(["username", "email", /^password.*/]);

//when you no longer care about the fields...
unregister();
//Or to keep these fields in the form values
unregister(true);
```

- `dispatch` & `ACTION_TYPE`
  Utilities to interface with the RxFormData instance

```typescript
//List of available actions
{
  REGISTER: "REGISTER_FIELDS",
  REGISTER_ALL: "REGISTER_ALL_FIELDS",
  UNREGISTER: "UNREGISTER_FIELDS",
  UNREGISTER_ALL: "UNREGISTER_ALL_FIELDS",
  ADD_DECODERS: "ADD_DECODERS",
  REMOVE_DECODERS: "REMOVE_DECODERS",
  CLEAR_DECODERS: "CLEAR_DECODERS",
  DESTROY: "DESTROY_PROGRAM"
};

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.REGISTER, payload: Array<string | RegExp>);

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.REGISTER_ALL); // registers all fields currently on the form elment

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.UNREGISTER, payload: Array<string | RegExp>); // keepvalues is set to false by default
dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.UNREGISTER, payload: { use: payload: Array<string | RegExp>, keepvalues: boolean });

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.UNREGISTER_ALL, keepvalues?: boolean);

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.ADD_DECODERS, payload: Array<{
  /** this is used as key on the formvalidaiton object */
  name: string;
  /** predicate functions (i.e validators) */
  use: Array<(formvalues: Readonly<Record<string, ...>>) => boolean>;
  /** error messages for validation failure(s) */
  messages: string[] | (context: Record<string, unknown>) => string | string[];
}>);

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.REMOVE_DECODERS, payload: Array<string | RegExp>);


dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.CLEAR_DECODERS); // clears all registered decoders

dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.DESTROY); // basically renders RxFormData inert
```

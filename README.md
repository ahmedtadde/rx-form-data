const { subscribe, dispatch, ACTION_TYPE } = RxFormData(
  "some-form-id",
  (formvalues, formdata) => {
    console.log("ON SUBMIT HANDLER CALLED", formvalues, formdata);
    return Promise.resolve([formvalues]);
  }
);

const unsubscribe = subscribe((formvalues) => {
  console.debug("FORM VALUES SUBSCRIBER", formvalues);
});

setTimeout(() => {
  unsubscribe();
}, 2 * 60 * 1000);

setTimeout(() => {
  dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.DESTROY);

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
npm install --save rx-form-data
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import RxFormData from "rx-form-data";

// using CommonJS modules
const RxFormData = require("rx-form-data");
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/rx-form-data/dist/rx-form-data.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.RxFormData`.

## Usage

```typescript
import RxFormData from "rx-form-data";

window.addEventListener("load", () => {
  const { subscribe, dispatch, ACTION_TYPE } = RxFormData(
    "some-form-id",
    (formvalues, formdata) => {
      console.log("ON SUBMIT HANDLER CALLED", formvalues, formdata);
      return Promise.resolve([formvalues]);
    }
  );

  const unsubscribe = subscribe((formvalues) => {
    console.debug("FORM VALUES SUBSCRIBER", formvalues);
  });

  setTimeout(() => {
    unsubscribe();
  }, 2 * 60 * 1000);

  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch(ACTION_TYPE.DESTROY);
  }, 3 * 60 * 1000);
});
```
